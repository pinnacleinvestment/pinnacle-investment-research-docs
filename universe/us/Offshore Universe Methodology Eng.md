## 1. Objective

This document outlines the methodology used to construct the *investment universe* for Pinnacle’s offshore portfolio management.
The goal is to ensure that the selection process for stocks and ETFs is conducted consistently, transparently, and based on measurable criteria.

---

## 2. Scope

This methodology covers the selection criteria for:
- **Stocks (equities)** that can be included in the offshore investment universe.
- **Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs)** that can be used in offshore investment strategies.

---

## 3. Selection Criteria

### 3.1 Stocks
Stocks eligible for inclusion in the investment universe are:
- Constituents of the **S&P 500 Index**.
- The composition of the stock universe will **automatically adjust to reflect changes in the S&P 500 Index** as published by Standard & Poor’s.

### 3.2 ETFs
ETFs eligible for inclusion in the investment universe must meet both of the following criteria:
1. **Assets Under Management (AUM)** of at least **USD 500 million**.

### 3.3 Dynamic Nature of the ETF List
- The ETF universe is **not static**, but **will expand and adjust** in line with the team’s evolving strategies and investment needs.
- Additional ETFs may be added to the universe as long as they meet the criteria stated in Section 3.2.
- Therefore, this methodology serves as a **general framework**, rather than a closed list of permissible ETFs.

---

## 4. Update Frequency

- **Stocks:** The composition of the stock universe will automatically reflect every **official update of the S&P 500 Index** made by Standard & Poor’s.
- **ETFs:** The ETF universe will be **reviewed quarterly (every 3 months)** to ensure all ETFs continue to meet the required AUM and liquidity criteria.
